# Battleship+

---

#### The classic game of naval warfare, reimagined as an online, multiplayer game that can be played with friends

At its core, Battleship+ is a web application consisting of client-side and server-side code. The front-end client UI/UX and game logic was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end server was built using NodeJS services and the ExpressJS framework. Bi-directional communication between the client and server are achieved using the Socket.IO library.

## Motivation

---

This web application combines two of my biggest interests, namely, web and game development. Much could be said about these topics in terms of technologies, frameworks, design principles, and more. However, being a newcomer to both fields, I wanted to create something simple that could push me to develop these new skills.

## Features

---

- Play against the enemy AI or a random opponent
- (WIP) Create an account to access game statistics (i.e. wins/losses)
- (WIP) Join online matchmaking lobbies to choose an opponent
- (WIP) Add players to their friend list
- (WIP) Challenge players in your friend list to a match

## Technology/Frameworks
